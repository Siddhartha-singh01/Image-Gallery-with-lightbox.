# 🖼️ Image Gallery with Lightbox

A sleek, responsive **Image Gallery** that allows users to view images beautifully with a **Lightbox effect**. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project enhances image browsing with smooth transitions, zoom effects, and intuitive navigation.

---

## ✨ Features

- 💡 **Lightbox Effect** — View images in a fullscreen modal with a dimmed background  
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** — Use arrow keys to navigate and `Esc` to close the lightbox  
- 🔍 **Smooth Transitions** — Elegant zoom and fade animations for a professional look  
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** — No external dependencies; built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

├── index.html         # Main HTML file

├── script.js          # JavaScript for lightbox functionality
└── images/            # Image assets
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The gallery displays thumbnail images in a grid layout.
2. When a user clicks on an image, a **lightbox modal** opens showing the larger version.
3. Users can navigate between images using next/previous buttons or arrow keys.
4. Pressing the **Esc key** or clicking outside the image closes the lightbox.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* Add **image captions** and descriptions
* Implement **dark/light mode toggle**
* Include **video support** in the lightbox
* Add **filtering and sorting** options for better organization

Would you like me to make this version for a **React-based Image Gallery** or a **Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS** version too? I can adapt the README to match your stack.
